##CrazyFM-Extensions
CrazyFM framework can be extended with different stuff.
Extension is an individual project, that has its own test build configuration.
To use extension in your project based on CrazyFM framework, all you have to do is to add extension compiled SWC or define its source path.
 
##Creating extension guidelines
The main goal is to keep framework clean, documented and tested.
That's why new extension apply all the rules:

* Your extension must have clean well-formatted code.
* It must have unit tests.
* It should be commented and contain AsDocs.
* It should be fully compatible with framework dependencies.
* It should contain README.md description.
* It should contain build configuration.
* It should be added to framework global build configuration.
